    "# Acknowledgment\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming was originally proposed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s. In Bellman's dynamic programming, problems are typically represented using states, actions, and transitions between states. Each state represents a specific configuration or situation in the problem domain, and actions define the possible decisions or choices that can be made from each state. This representation allows for a more structured approach to problem-solving and optimization. Throughout this notebook, we will use a more general, modern definition for dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming has many definitions, but can be summarized as method of breaking down a larger problem into sub-problems, so that if you work through the sub-problems in the right order, building each answer on the previous one, you eventually solve the larger problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two attributes a problem needs to have in order to be classified as a dynamic programming problem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimal Substructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem can be deduced from optimal solutions of some or all of its subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overlapping Subproblems:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which can be reused several times or a recursive algorithm would solve the same subproblem more than once resulting in repeated work. (If the subproblems do not overlap, the algorithm is categorized as a \"divide and conquer\" algorithm rather than a dynamic programming algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have deduced that a problem has both of these properties, we can use dynamic programming principles in order to solve the problem in an efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a dynamic programming problem, it is common to start by implementing a brute force solution which explores all subproblems and returns a solution. We can then extend our solution to use a cache to store the results of any subproblems encountered, such that when the subproblem is encountered again we do not need to re-compute the result, instead we can simply look up the cache in constant time. This is known as \"memoization\", or \"top-down dynamic programming\". We can then look for any patterns in the cache table which, given an initialization (usually the base case of the recursive solution), would allow us to compute the values stored in the cache without ever traversing the decision tree of the problem itself. This is known as \"tabulation\", or \"bottom-up dynamic programming\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate this, we will use a simple problem called The Fibonacci Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fibonacci Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is as follows: Given a positive integer n, compute the n'th number in the Fibonacci sequence (where fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 1 and fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "n = 7, result = 13\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is as follows: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the 7th number in the sequence is 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brute Force Approach to the Fibonacci Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a brute force approach which will use recursion. The base cases are fib(1) = 1 and fib(2) = 1. By definition, the recursive case is fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of the brute force solution is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Feel free to run the code throughout this notebook for yourself on your own inputs in order to get a better understanding of the algorithms used.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see just how inefficient this approach is by selecting even a moderate value for n, such as 50."

Since the original problem was to calculate fib(19) + fib(18), and we need fib(18) to calculate fib(19), the calculation of fib(18) is repeated. \n",

This branching factor leads to an exponential growth in the number of function calls. The number of function calls grows exponentially with n, as each level of the tree doubles the number of function calls. Therefore the time complexity of this approach is 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^n which is O(2^n).\n",

    "\n",
    "This simple adjustment involves storing a (key, value) table called memo, where the key is an intermediate subproblem and the value is the intermediate result of that subproblem. Now, for any subproblem, we first check if the result is in memo, and if it is we return the result of that calculation in constant time. If the subproblem is not in memo, we calculate the intermediate result and cache it in memo.\n",

    "# Performance Analysis of the Various Approaches to the Discussed Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents a comparative analysis of dynamic programming algorithms, focusing on their computational efficiency. Using Python's timeit module, we conduct timed experiments to measure the execution performance of these algorithms across varying input sizes and scenarios. We aim to evaluate the scalability and practical effectiveness of these algorithms in solving real-world computational problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Timeit Library\n",
    "\n",
    "This module provides a simple way to time small bits of Python code. It has both a Command-Line Interface as well as a callable one. It avoids a number of common traps for measuring execution times. See also Tim Peters’ introduction to the “Algorithms” chapter in the second edition of Python Cookbook, published by O’Reilly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some of the common traps for measuring execution time that timeit avoids:\n",
    "\n",
    "Warm-up Time: The timeit module runs the code multiple times (by default, 1 million times) to ensure that any overhead related to JIT compilation or other one-time operations is amortized and doesn't skew the timing results. This helps ensure that the measured time reflects the actual performance of the code snippet, rather than the overhead of the Python interpreter starting up or other initialization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "External Factors: timeit executes the code in a controlled environment, minimizing the impact of external factors such as other processes running on the system, I/O operations, or system load. This helps ensure that the timing measurements are as consistent and reliable as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage Collection: The timeit module disables the garbage collector during timing measurements to prevent it from interfering with the results. Garbage collection can introduce variability in execution times, especially for short code snippets, so disabling it helps ensure more consistent timing measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timer Resolution: timeit uses high-resolution timers to measure execution times accurately, taking into account the system's timer resolution. This helps avoid inaccuracies that can arise from low-resolution timers, especially when measuring very short code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilation: For code snippets that are executed multiple times, timeit compiles the code to bytecode to speed up execution. This compilation step is done automatically and transparently, helping to reduce overhead and improve the accuracy of timing measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmarking Algorithms on Inputs of Size N.\n",
    "\n",
    "When benchmarking algorithms with a variable input size, we cannot simply run the code multiple times on the same fixed input, as we cannot be sure if this input accurately reflects the average runtime of the algorithm. Instead, on each run, the input size is fixed but the input itself is randomized. If we do this enough times, we should converge on the actual average runtime of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help demonstrate this point, we can look at the worst case runtime of Quicksort O(n^2), compared to its average case runtime O(nlogn). If we were to test quicksort vs Mergesort on a list that's sorted in reverse order, Mergesort would almost certainly come out on top, which is not indicative of the actual average runtimes of the algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach to Benchmarking the Fibonacci Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to benchmark the Fibonacci Problem, we do not need any randomization. We can simply input n, the index of the fibonacci number to be computed, and calculate the amount of time each of the brute force, memoization and tabulation approaches take to solve for fib(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach to Benchmarking the Coin Change Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to benchmark the Coin Change Problem, we must randomize a list of coin denominations D of fixed size, and a total amount a, in order to get an accurate insight into the average runtime. The maximum and minimum size of the coin denominations and the total amount should be kept consistent throughout test runs to reduce the amount of variance. Ideally, the inputs to each of the brute force, memoization and tabulation algorithms should be the same on each run to avoid the case where one of the algorithms \"gets lucky\" and consistently gets \"easier\" inputs than the others. For simplicity, we se the target amount to the length of D.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: make sure D_min is not 0, as having a zero size coin will make the brute force and memoization solution never terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach to Benchmarking Problems With Single List Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to benchmark problems with single list inputs, we must randomize a list nums of fixed size in order to get an accurate insight into the average runtime. The maximum and minimum size of the elements of nums should be kept consistent throughout test runs to reduce the amount of variance. Ideally, the inputs to each of the brute force, memoization and tabulation algorithms should be the same on each run to avoid the case where one of the algorithms \"gets lucky\" and consistently gets \"easier\" inputs than the others. For simplicity, the max number size in nums is set to nums, and the minimum is set to 1 or -1 * the length of nums.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach to Benchmarking the Binomial Coefficients Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to benchmark the Binomial Coefficients Problem, we do not need any randomization. We can simply input n and k, and calculate the average time each of the brute force, memoization and tabulation approaches take to solve for C(n,k). For simplicity, we take k as n/2."
